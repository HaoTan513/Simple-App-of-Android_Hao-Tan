# Simple-App-of-Android_Hao-Tan
The homework 2 of EC601 A1, try to build up a simple app of Android, learn as much as we can ourselves.

This trial is just the beginning. I met some problems in the process of this homwork, but I will keep working on it. Our project of EC601 A1 this semester is the screen sharing of Andriod, in the next coming months I will continuely spend more time on it and go deeper in Android studio.

This is the repository of the first-edition of the simple app for the homework 2. Some new things haven't been addd into it yet because of some problems I met. Will keep updating after the due.
